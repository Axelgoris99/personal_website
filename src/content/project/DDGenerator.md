As a group of 3, we created a Dungeon & Dragon character generator using Vue and Firebase, as part of the best course I ever had: DH2642. That was made to practice implementing a Model-View-Presenter to understand the proper architecture of a software.

That was basically randomly generating attributes, getting data from a 3rd party API and browsing the internet for cool pictures.
