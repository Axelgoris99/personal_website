Playing around with procedural generation and mesh refinement in Unity. I tried both marching cube and wave function collapse. They are realy fun to play with!

I've been looking at this for a few years but it took me quite some time to wrap my head around how it worked.

Unfortunately, the code is missing quite some comments for another dev to work with...

You can find an implementation here: <https://github.com/Axelgoris99/Wave-Function-Collapse-Unity>
