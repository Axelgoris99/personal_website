Remember that this was in 2021 and AI was not such a big thing yet.

I did my first step into ML through this project, trying to automatically rig a human in Blender and extract length of different bones through a photo scan.

In the end, we still suggested our responsible to use some well-known blender plugin to quickly rig a human.
