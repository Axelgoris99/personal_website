I implemented a random karate technique generator to help with learning techniques name and Kihon.

The website was inspired by my dad practice who often found himself doing the same technique. To diversify it, I added techniques onto a database, with the grade they are supposed to be learned at, a description and a picture and you'd get a combination of 1 to 10 techniques depending on your grade and what you want (you can specify the techniques you want or the type of techniques).

There is also a "Grading" tab for training with pre-determined and well-known combination of techniques.

You can also find a Quiz tab that needs to link the correct name to the correct oral pronunciation or picture or description. To go with that, a high score system was implemented as well as an authentication service using firebase. Once the authentication was done, I also added a Ippon Kumite tab to help with remembering what techniques you chose in your ippon kumite.

Finally a glossary was added to help learn techniques in a bit more "serious" way.

All fully responsive (hopefully it still is?)
