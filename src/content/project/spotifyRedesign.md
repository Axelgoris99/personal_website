The concept was simple: old people are not using Spotify and such as much as new generation.

We made a whole user study to identify pain point and how could we help them navigate the new environment at first. That was inspired by 5 interviews with old people who did not want to discover new music but rather have their old music available everywhere.

Thus, we asked how did they usually listen to music and what could help them and we found out that most of them also had a huge collection of CDs or vinyles. In order to help them transition from one to the other, we suggested adding a scan feature to Spotify as well as a collection tab that would be a little bit more visual and feel more like what they were used to.

A first very rough prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/gaiatY4ZRqgNuJIHzJ82rc/Spotify---Mobile-UI-(Community)?type=design&node-id=764-14492&t=CyAG3X2vjJN4PLVg-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=25%3A0&starting-point-node-id=570%3A4308&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design)
