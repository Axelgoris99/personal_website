You get a grid of letters on one TV and then people connect to the game room and can submit words that can be formed (adjacent letters) using a web app on their phone. There are interactions and all and it is pretty cool!

On the picture, you have the main interface on the left and the web interface that people use to connect on the right.

I've tested it with 9 people and it worked fine.

Steam link incoming!
