I coded a full QR Code Generator because I wanted to learn about code correction and QR Code, all in C++, helping myself with the help of [Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library)'s code.

I then tried to embed picture inside of QR Code thanks to its code correcting ability and I got some interesting results as you can see on the attached picture.

The code can be found here: <https://github.com/Axelgoris99/QR_Embed>
