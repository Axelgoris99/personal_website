I'm recreating the [following serie](http://theliquidfire.com/2015/05/04/tactics-rpg-series-intro/) of tutorial using Godot Script in Godot. This serves as a basis for a potential game and a basis for learning how to work with Godot.

Also note that I have been actively following and appreciating or giving advice on <https://theliquidfire.com/2023/11/09/godot-tactics-rpg-01-intro-setup/>.
