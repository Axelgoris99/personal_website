I'm recreating the [following serie](http://theliquidfire.com/2015/05/04/tactics-rpg-series-intro/) of tutorial using C# in Godot. This serves as a basis for a potential game and a basis for learning how to work with Godot.

The github is here: <https://github.com/Axelgoris99/TTRPG_Godot>

If I motivate myself, you might be able to read more about the process in a dedicated blog.
