A game jam project where you had to pair people together depending on what they liked.
The project was well appreciated with the judge appreciation being:

"
Honestly, this was a really cool little game. I liked how it related to the theme, and did it in a cute way. The models of the characters were funny, and I laughed at the Options menu. I like the visuals, the choice of the room to be simple, and the character models were all good. The music was really chill and a good choice for the vibe of the game. The game played pretty smoothly, but the highlighting of the characters might have been too subtle. I left clicked on one first, and the didn't understand why the information didn't pop up when I right clicked (I needed to deselect first), and I think that was the only issue - more of a UI thing. Otherwise, the game ran smoothly. The only other thing was that I didn't get the point system. I tried matching the cat lover with the fireman, and got the most points, but when I tried to match the two boardgames people together, I got no points. It wasn't clear if I was losing points by not matching some people. I think point totals, or indicators might help in the future. This seems like a genuinely fun game to get into. I could see everything from a wider narrative, to just some fun characters and quirky matchups. I hope that you expand on this some day if you feel like it, and that you learned a lot from the jam. Good job!"

As pointed out in this review; we're missing a lot of UI but having a very smooth experience after not even 3 days of coding is already something I'm proud of.
