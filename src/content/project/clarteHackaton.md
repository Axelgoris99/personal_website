Clarte is where I made my first engineering internship but before that, they had organized a game jam at Centrale Nantes.

During this game jam, we were a group of 4 who developed a small Augmented Reality game where you add to help a small cute rabbit go through multiple obstacles in the fashion of a child book game.
