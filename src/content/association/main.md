As the description says, I was one of the event manager for MAIN at KTH.

So, MAIN is the MAsters and INternational students organization at KTH (Stockholm) and we're responsible for helping student find friends, have fun and more generally a good time. I was one of the 7 responsible: 4 event managers, 1 treasurer, 1 communication manager, 1 president.

We organized multiple events, most notably a three-course dinner where we designed the meal, the decoration, the animation and the whole evening with another event manager. That included recruiting staff members, committee members and coming with a very solid organization in order to serve 80 persons at the same time (or approximately...). Said theme was chosen to be Alice in Wonderland, where I got to be the Queen of Heart and have a lovely time screaming at everyone.
