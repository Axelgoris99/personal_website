[DH2642 - Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2642?l=en)

Probably the best class I ever took and I decided to help continue the tradition by becoming a teacher assistant and helping students to advance in the various projects.

I was helping and grading students during the first half of the course.

During the second half, I was responsible for 5 groups having to design and develop their own web applications and host it.

That's how I truly became a frontend developer, by looking at many persons code, finding what was their goal, guiding them, refactoring my own code in the process, etc.
