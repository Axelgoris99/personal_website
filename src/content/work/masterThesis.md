For my end of study internship at KTH (a.k.a "Master Thesis"), I did:

- Realize a state of the art of the use of eye-tracking and interaction modalities including little or no user's movements to interact with his avatar in Virtual Reality.
- Find a research angle that has not yet been explored in depth and that has a concrete use (e.g. rehabilitation of paralyzed people through VR)
- Set up one or more experiments to measure and validate our research hypotheses on these interaction modalities and their usability, feeling of embodiment, etc.
- Conduct user tests to collect data and establish conclusions.
- To write a research paper to summarize the entire research.

The github is currently private due to the use of paid assets.
