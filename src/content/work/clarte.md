  I developed a Mixed Reality Experience to design UI and change it in realtime in a simulation, with a video see through headset, colocalization and eye-tracking.

Worked to create a quick interface prototyping tool with viso-haptic co-location and eye tracking using a mixed reality see-through headset.

Created a co-location algorithm to align both real and virtual object.

Created post-processing shader in order to create a high quality Heatmap by using eye-tracking on the user.
