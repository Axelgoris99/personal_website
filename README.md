# Axel Goris: Personal website

I'm currently using the Astro Starter Kit as a template. Works great!

Unless I keep breaking things with Git...

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## Deploy Steps

1. Build the app
2. Use rsync to sync on the server.
   rsync -au -v --exclude='\*.mp4' /home/user/Documents/Software/personal_website/dist/ root@ip/home/portfolio/dist/
   Note that this is not the final destination.
3. On your server, copy paste from /home/portfolio/dist to the place where your caddy file config is looking.
4. All done.
